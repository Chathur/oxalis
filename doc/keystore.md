# Certificates, keys and key stores in Oxalis

The purpose of this document is to guide you in how to set up your PEPPOL certificates in order to make Oxalis "tick".

## What are certificates used for?

PEPPOL has defined a PKI structure which allows for prudent governance of the access points, the SMP's and so on.

The PKI structure comes in two releases:

* V1 which is the current (as of May 2013) scheme. It was initially launched as part of the PEPPOL project a couple of
years ago.
* V2 is the new PKI scheme to be implemented and activated during the summer and autumn of 2013.
